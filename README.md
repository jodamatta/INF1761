## INF1761 - Computer Graphics course at PUC-Rio

### Summary 
This course is for understanding the basics of Computer Graphics with OpenGL as a tool. We cover scene graphs, shaders, lighting, textures, etc. It consists of two projects: one in 2D and another one in 3D.
If you want to run any code in this repository, you should follow this steps:
- Download the GLFW, GLAD, stb, and glm libraries;
- Import all files in the directory into the same folder;

### T1 - Solar System Project:
The goal of this project was to render a 2D mini Solar System with textures and transformations. It consists of:
  - The Sun, static at the center of the frame;
  - Mercury, orbiting around the Sun;
  - The Earth, orbiting around the Sun a bit further back;
  - The Moon, orbiting the Earth.

### T2 - 3D Scene Project:
The goal of this project was to render a 3D scene of our choice, applying render techniques. For this scene, I chose to implement a clipplane and a projective texture.

### T3 - Rendering Algorithms Project:
The goal of this project was to apply two of the rendering algorithms we were introduced to in class, in a 3D scene. I chose to implement a reflective texture using stencils and planar shadows.
